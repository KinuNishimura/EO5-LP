You there, are you a new adventurer? You just came out of the Explorers Guild.
If so, then, as the town crier, I have something to tell you.
New explorers must report to the Council to receive a mission.
Think of it as test to have the town officially recognize you as explorers.
If you plan to work here as explorers, then you have no choice but to take it.
If you understand, then head to the Arcadian Council.

There is a new announcement from the Council to all explorers!
Today, the Arcadian Council is assigning a new mission!
The goal is to explore the 1st Stratum!
All guilds confident in their skills should report to the Council.

There is a new announcement from the Council to all explorers!
Today, the Arcadian Council is assigning a new mission!
Furthermore, because this mission would be far too dangerous for anyone less than a Master, only previously recognized guilds may participate!
All applicable guilds confident in their skills should report to the Council.

Hey, you!
You were just in the Labyrinth, right?
Did you see Lily anywhere after you talked to me?!
[End]

-- ID 251 --
[b]What will you say?[/b]
"We haven't seen her."
"Did something happen?"
[End]

-- ID 252 --
...Dammit!
She... Lily's disappeared!
She's been brooding over something a lot recently...
I was out looking so I told her to wait in the inn...but when I got back, she was gone.
I've been looking around town, but I haven't seen her anywhere.
Don't tell me she went looking by herself...
...
I-I'm heading to the Labyrinth to look for her!
You guys make sure she's not in town for me!
Or if you find Lily, tell her to stay put!

So you're all with [Guild Name], right?
I've got a message from the Guildmaster, Edgar.
"I've got something to tell you now that you're official explorers. Come to the Guild."
Well, that was it. He didn't tell me what this was about, so you'll have to ask him yourself at the [b]Explorers Guild[/b].
Anyway, I've gotta get back to my patrol, so if you'll excuse me...
[End]

-- ID 450 --
I heard you went to a new stratum, so I've been waiting for you.
Find anything good there? I could make a killing off of anything new and strange.
Hmm?
You sure look pleased with yourselves. So I'm guessing you did?

[Color:0x0005]How will you reply?[Color:0x0000]
"Sure did."
"You sure can tell."
[End]

-- ID 452 --
I knew it!
C'mon, let me have a look.
[End]

-- ID 453 --
'Course I can tell!
C'mon, let me have a look.

I see... Interesting...
This is...a [b]Dragon Crystal Fragment[/b].
The legends say it's a scale from the Crystal Dragon, crystallized. It's crazy rare!
Oh, but... I hate to tell you this, but it doesn't make for good armor.
It'd shatter into a billion pieces as soon as it takes an impact.
But still, rich folks like nobles and foreign merchants will pay a pretty penny for it, so it's pretty valuable to me!
Just send 'em my way whenever you pick one up.
So, was there anything else?
...What? The cave was blocked by crystals? You can't get any further in?
Hmm...that's a tough one...
Oh, wait right there!
I'll be right back!
[End]

-- ID 455 --
Sorry for the wait!
*pant, pant* Geez, this is heavy...
Anyway, you can have this.
[End]

-- ID 456 --
I had it custom-made way back because I wanted to get my hands on some real hard minerals, but it's way too heavy for me.
It's just been collecting dust since.
But I can guarantee it should smash those crytals in your way easily!

So if you find any good crystals or ore further in, make sure to sell 'em to me!
See ya later!

[Guild Name]!
Marvellous, I've heard you reached the top of Yggdrasil!
You have to tell me all about it sometime!
But first... I want you to report to the Council.
Lord Remus has been dying to hear the news.
[End]

-- ID 550 --
Ho, I see you've returned to town.
In that case, I shall return to Yggdrasil.
Let's meet up in the 6th Stratum.
Until we meet again, [Guild Name].
[End]

-- ID 1000 --
Oh, it's everyone from [Guild Name]!
How've you been?
Actually, it's been a while, hasn't it?
Ever since you helped me out, I hear you've been causing quite the stir.
So you just got back from exploring?
Oh, what's this?
You're carrying these weird logs I've never seen before.
What? You got them on the 5th Stratum?
Wow! You've already reached the 5th Stratum?!
I always thought of you guys as newbies, but before I know it, you're ahead of us, huh?
Man, if those are from the 5th Stratum, then they must be great! I mean, I don't know the details, but I can sorta tell, you know?
...Oh, I know!
I just thought up something good!
I'll be off now, later!
I'll be at the [BAR NAME].

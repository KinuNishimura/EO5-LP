For this reason, no one approaches the tree; in fact, it has been forbidden by order of the council that governs Aeolis.
...However, at some point, they released a proclamation:
"To all adventurers on the continent of Arcadia: come to Aeolis and challenge Yggdrasil."
From the Earthrun race, who live all over Arcadia, came fencers, dragoons, cesti, and those known as reapers...
From the magic tower to the north, where the Lunaria carry out magical research, came warlocks and necromancers...
From the mountain-dwelling Therians came those who carry the blood of might warriors...
From the plains-dwelling Brownies came those called herbalists and shamans...
Seeking adventure, they all gathered in this town, their chests swelled with pride.
...
You, too, are an adventurer who set out for Aeolis, your heart gripped by the exciting proclamation.
You have but one goal: to challenge the labyrinth of Yggdrasil, and explore its unknown forests.
If you've made up your mind, then let the adventure begin!

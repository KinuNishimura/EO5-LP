For this reason, no one approaches the tree, and in fact it had been forbidden by order of the council that governs Aeolis.
...However, at some point they released a proclamation.
To all adventurers on the continent of Arcadia: come to Aeolis and challenge Yggdrasil.
From the Earthrun race who lived all over the continent came fencers, dragoons, cesti, and those known as reapers...
From the magic tower to the north where the Lunaria carry out magical research came warlocks and necromancers...
From the mountain dwelling Therians came those who carry the blood of mighty warriors...
From the plains-dwelling Bronie came those called herbalists and shaman...
Seeking adventure, they all gathered in this town, their chests swelled with pride.
...
You, too, are an adventurer who set out for Aeolis, your heart gripped by the exciting proclamation.
You have but one goal: to tackle the labyrinth of Yggdrasil and explore its unknown forests.
If you've made up your mind, then set forth on adventure!

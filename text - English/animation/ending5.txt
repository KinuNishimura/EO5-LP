You, who descend from those born and raised on this planet:
[End]

-- ID 1 --
Well done.
[End]

-- ID 2 --
As I mentioned earlier,
[End]

-- ID 3 --
long ago this planet was ruled by darkness.
[End]

-- ID 4 --
In this land where nothing was born,
[End]

-- ID 5 --
Someone planted the World Tree to bring life.
[End]

-- ID 6 --
That would be my people, the "Archon".
[End]

-- ID 7 --
Over the many years the Archon have watched over this planet,
[End]

-- ID 8 --
it has become a land full of life.
[End]

-- ID 9 --
"Archon" tells you that
[End]

-- ID 10 --
every time in the past that the world was threated by one of many crises,
[End]

-- ID 11 --
the people were saved through the blessings of the World Tree.
[End]

-- ID 12 --
That she had a duty to protect that seed,
[End]

-- ID 13 --
until the day humanity overcame the primordial darkness.
[End]

-- ID 14 --
That, since you appeared,
[End]

-- ID 15 --
and overcame the primordial darkness,
[End]

-- ID 16 --

[End]

-- ID 17 --
And that you need to travel the world...
[End]

-- ID 18 --
With this, my duty here is over,
[End]

-- ID 19 --
so I should be leaving.
[End]

-- ID 20 --
In much the same way, your adventure ends here.
[End]

-- ID 21 --
This is the surely last stop of your journey around the World Tree.
[End]

-- ID 22 --
But after "Archon" is gone,
[End]

-- ID 23 --
you must overcome your next trial: watching over the world.
[End]

-- ID 24 --
The duty is a heavy burden, to be sure,
[End]

-- ID 25 --
but I know you can do it.
[End]

-- ID 26 --
You, who walked this labyrinth,
[End]

-- ID 27 --
and surely know better than anyone 
[End]

-- ID 28 --
how important it is to cooperate.
[End]
